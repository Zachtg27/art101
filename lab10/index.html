		<h1>Lab 10: Javascript events and forms</h1>
		<h3>Challenges</h3>
			<p>I am currently enrolled in another class where we have to code entire games in javascript so I did
				not experience any challenges.</p>
		<h3>Problems</h3>
			<p>It took me a little bit to figure this one out but the only problem I had was my button input was inside
			my form divide and that was causing my program to perform incorrectly</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<h3>Script Output</h3>
		<form>
			<label for="user-name">Input your name: </label>
			<input type="text" id="user-name" name="user-name">
		</form>
		<button onclick="sortName(document.getElementById('user-name').value)">Submit</button>
