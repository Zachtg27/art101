			<p>All of my labs are working correctly at the moment so theres not really anything for me to deubug, but I remember having some issues
			with this lab. I started off by creating my buttons wrong so they could not be linked via event listener so I commented out a bunch of
			things and checked the console until I found the lines that were causing the issue. It turns out I was using a wierd input type at first.
			This was an issue I had earlt on in the lab, and once I fixed it the rest of it was working well. </p>
