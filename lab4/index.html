			<h1>Lab 4 Pseudocode</h1>

			<h3>Challenges</h3>
				<p>The challenge of this lab was to learn how to pseudocode by doing it with things you already understand, the point
					of this is to make life simpler when we start coding larger more complicated html projects.
					I did not find this lab very challenging because I have coding experience. In the many labs I have done I have learned the
					importance of pseudocode. It tends to make things way more organized and simple.</p>
			<h3>Problems</h3>
				<p>I did not experience any problems with this lab.</p>
			<h3>Results</h3>
